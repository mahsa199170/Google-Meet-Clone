# Google-Meet-Clone
The Google Meet Clone project aims to create a web-based video conferencing application that allows multiple participants to connect to a single room and participate in real-time video and audio calls.

The application will offer a similar set of features to Google Meet, including the ability to create a new meeting, join an existing meeting, invite participants via a unique link, turn on/off the camera and microphone, and chat with other participants during the meeting.  The project will be developed using Node.js with Express.js as the backend framework, and React.js as the frontend framework. WebRTC will be used for real-time communication between participants in the meeting, and Socket.io will be used for real-time chat functionality.  The project will also incorporate various metrics to measure the performance of the system, including tracking the number of participants in a meeting, meeting duration, audio and video quality, and network latency. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will be set up to automate the testing and deployment process.
